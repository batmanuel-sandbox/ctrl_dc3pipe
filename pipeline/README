This directory contains the recommended policy files for running the
DC3 (Alert Production) pipelines.  The following files represent the
top-level production policy files:

  dc3pipe.paf              process CFHT data on NFS filesystem
  dc3pipe-cfht-lustre.paf  process CFHT data on Lustre filesystem
  dc3pipe-sim-nfs.paf      process simulated data on NFS filesystem
  dc3pipe-sim-lustre.paf   process simulated data on Lustre filesystem

Note: due to a bug in the ctrl_orca package, the pipeline level
      pipelines must be named pipeline-name.paf where pipeline-name is
      the short name of the pipeline (e.g. IPSD, ap, and nightmops).
      Thus, to use the above mentioned production files, one must
      rename the corresponding, restricted pipeline policy name
      (i.e. IPSD.paf, ap.paf, and nightmops.paf).
