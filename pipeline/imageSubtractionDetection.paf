# Stage 1: link the input data into the DC2root tree
appStages: "lsst.pex.harness.SymLinkStage.SymLinkStage" 

# Stage 2: load input data (science and template images) into memory
appStages: "lsst.pex.harness.IOStage.InputStage"

# Stage 3: transform the per-visit metadata
appStages: "lsst.ip.diffim.pipeline.VisitMetadataStage"

# Stage 4: persist the per-visit metadata
appStages: "lsst.pex.harness.IOStage.OutputStage"

# Stage 5: persist the Exposure with its metadata

# Stage 6: subtract the images
appStages: "lsst.ip.diffim.pipeline.ImageSubtractStage" 

# Stage 7: write out the difference image
