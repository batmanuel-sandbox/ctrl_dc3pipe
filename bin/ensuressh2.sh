This script will set attempt to set up SSH keys and related files on all 
nodes in the node list:

EOF
for node in $nodes; do
    echo "   $node"
done
cat <<EOF

This will be done by first creating the SSH keys locally and then transfering 
them to each of the machines.  This will involve logging into each machine.
Each time, you will likely be asked for a password; enter your password at 
that time.  Subsequently, you may type your password many times, once for 
each host.  When this script is complete, you will be set up with password-less 
logins.
